### **Core Features**:

1. **Agentic Workflow**:
   - Implement autonomous agents to monitor markets, analyze trends, and generate periodic reports.
   - Agents can trigger actions, such as retrieving updated financial statements, scraping regulatory filings, or detecting sentiment changes in the news.

2. **Vector Database Integration**:
   - Store and query financial data (e.g., earnings call transcripts, news articles, SEC filings) efficiently using a vector database for semantic search and similarity analysis.
   - Enable instant access to contextually relevant documents and data.

3. **Web Scraping Pipelines**:
   - Use AI-powered web scraping tools to collect data from financial websites, forums, news outlets, and government filings.
   - Extract key insights like earnings announcements, policy updates, or macroeconomic indicators in real-time.

4. **LLMs for Analysis**:
   - Integrate LLMs like GPT for generating summaries, answering complex queries, and providing insights from large datasets.
   - Example: “What are the key risks mentioned in the annual report of Tesla?”

5. **Financial Modelling Automation**:
   - Automate spreadsheet creation and data visualization using AI. Example: Generate dynamic models based on uploaded financial reports or scraped data.

6. **Customizable Dashboards**:
   - Build intuitive dashboards for users to track KPIs, market trends, and AI-generated predictions tailored to their investment strategies.

7. **Compliance and Risk Insights**:
   - Use AI to assess compliance risks, monitor regulatory changes, and flag anomalies in transactions or portfolios.

### **Potential Use Cases**:
- Hedge funds tracking investment opportunities.
- Financial advisors automating client reporting.
- Retail investors gaining insights from unstructured data.
- Private market investors processing pitch decks, term sheets, and data rooms.

### **Technical Stack**:
1. **Vector Database**: Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus for semantic search.
2. **LLMs**: OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, or similar.
3. **Pipelines**: Prefect, Apache Airflow, or custom orchestration frameworks.
4. **Web Scraping**: Scrapy, Puppeteer, or Beautiful Soup, enhanced with AI tools like Diffbot or Parsio.
5. **Frontend**: React.js or Vue.js for dashboards.
6. **Backend**: FastAPI or Flask for API integrations.
7. **Cloud**: AWS/GCP/Azure for scalable deployment.
